<h3>About Catseye</h3>
<p>
CatsEye is a java application conceived and developed by Douglas Easterly and Ben Jack. Its primary aim is to lend a powerful tool for intuitively sketching complex patterns that can be easily integrated into creative practices. This tool may be useful for 3D texture artists, fine artists, graphic designers, fashion designers, interior designers, or any other discipline where patterning a surface is a part of studio processes.</p>

<p>The project was launched through a 2014 URF grant from Victoria University of Wellington and has developed out of the Media Design - Computer Graphics programme launched in 2012. Potential postgraduate students interested in this software, or developing creative software in general, are encouraged to contact us. Similarly, we would like to hear from interested companies who think this software may be useful as part of their studio production. </p>
